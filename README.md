# Predicting the Risk Probability of Developing Chronic Medical Conditions from a Depression Dataset
_Final Project for Data Science_

## üìú Deskripsi  
**Business Problem:**
Healthcare providers face increasing challenges in managing the growing number of patients with chronic medical conditions. Prevention is more cost-effective than treatment, but identifying individuals at high risk before symptoms manifest is difficult due to the complex interplay of lifestyle, socio-economic, and genetic factors.

**The goal of this projects are:**
Predict the likelihood of developing chronic medical conditions based on individual attributes
Design personalized prevention strategies for high-risk individuals.

4. **Rekomendasi**  
  1. Focus on Low-Income Segments
    * Strategy:
      Prioritize low-income individuals in prevention programs, such as providing subsidized or free healthcare services.
    * Operational Recommendations:
      Launch health education programs and regular check-ups for individuals from low-income groups.
  2. Improve Health Scores through Preventive Programs
    * Strategy:
      Identify individuals with low health scores and offer data-based interventions, such as exercise programs, diets, or regular health check-ups.
    * Operational Recommendations:
      Establish partnerships with gyms, nutritionists, or health platforms to support customers in improving their health scores.
  3. Promote a Healthy Lifestyle
    * Strategy:
      A healthy lifestyle campaign, such as reducing smoking and alcohol consumption, and increasing exercise.
    * Operational Recommendations:
      Hold healthy lifestyle seminars and workshops for the community.
